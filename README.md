# DailyDiscord

DailyDiscord is a discord bot, used to do some actions in the discord server r/DailyGames Official.

This code is shared to give people insight in how this bot works. You are free to use (parts of) this code to create a discord bot of your own!

## Usage

The code cannot be run in its current state. To run it, you need to:

1. Set up a reddit bot (Create app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)
2. Fill in the account details in a file called 'praw.ini'
3. Run the file 'fill_database_after_failure.py'
4. Create a file called '.env' with information on your discord bot and the server. Syntax:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=token
DISCORD_GUILD=server name (I am using r/DailyGames Official)
DISCORD_CHANNEL=channel name (I am using new-post-links-ðŸ†•)
```

5. You can start running the bot by running 'Discord_bot.py'. Note that when you use Windows, you will sometimes get an error message. However, this is no problem, you can ignore that. It is a known bug with the python implementation of the discord API in Windows.
